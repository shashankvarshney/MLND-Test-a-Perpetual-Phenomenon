## Project Description

This project will analyze the claim of Stroop effect.

### What is Stroop effect

  In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participantâ€™s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition.

  1. **Congruent words condition:** The words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed: for example RED(in Red font color), BLUE(in Blue font color).

  2. **Incongruent words condition:** The words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed: for example PURPLE(not In Purple font color), ORANGE(not in Orange font color).

  In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition.

### Claim of Stroop effect

  **[Stroop effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect) claims that person usually takes higher time in name the ink color in Incongruent scenario as compared to Congruent scenario**.


## Environment and Programming Language

* Python 2.7.14 has been used.
* Miniconda framework has been used which can be downloaded from this [link](https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/).
* Once installed, open conda prompt.
* Create virtual environment by using `conda env create -f environment.yaml`. **environment.yaml** has been included in the repository.
* Jupyter notebook has been used for interactively working on the problem statement.


## Data Description

  [Data Set](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9Yf01UaIbUgQXpYb2NhZ29yX1U/view?usp%3Dsharing&sa=D&ust=1515913787649000&usg=AFQjCNF-f2PgaUNm8VNJtVqVHr6ZEntcgA) contains 25 persons who has taken both of these tests, that is, Congruent and Incongruent word conditions and time has been recorded which is given in the data for each person.

### Type of Variables
  1. **Dependent Variable:** Dependent variable is time taken by each person in naming the ink colors for words.
  2. **Independent Variable:** Independent variable is type of test, that is, **Congruent or Incongruent word conditions**.
